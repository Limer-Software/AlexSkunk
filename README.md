# Alex Skunk
Welcome to the Alex Skunk repository!

## Well, what is this?
Alex Skunk is a Discord bot that I made just for pure fun!
But, there are a few things that I see that are missing from other bots, or
are just not as good as I would like them to be. So, I decided to make my own
bot.

## What can it do?
There are a few characteristics that I want to implement in this bot:
- [ ] A custom role shop for each server with their own currency.
- [ ] An appealing system for banned users.
- [ ] A custom music player with a queue system.
- [x] Emoji analysis (even built-in emojis).
- [ ] A captcha system for new users (easier and more secure than CaptchaBot).
- [ ] An advanced detection system to prevent raiders from joining.
- [ ] A warning log for each user.
- [ ] A deleted message log for each user.
- [ ] A builder helper for Discord servers.
- [ ] Maybe custom responses with ChatGPT for fun responses...
**MAYBE, _DON'T KILL ME PLEASE_**.

## Getting Started
See the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more information on how to set up the bot.

## How can I contribute?
You can contribute by making a pull request with your changes. I will review
them and merge them if they are good enough. If you want to contribute, but
don't know how, you can always open an issue and I will try to fix it as soon
as possible.
